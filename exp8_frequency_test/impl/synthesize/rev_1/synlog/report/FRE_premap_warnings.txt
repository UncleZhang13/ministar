@W: FX474 |User-specified initial value defined for some sequential elements which can prevent optimum synthesis results from being achieved. 
@W: MT529 :"e:\project_manager\mini_eye_board\gowin\course\course15_fre\fre\src\btn_deb.v":37:4:37:9|Found inferred clock top_freq|clk which controls 108 sequential elements including u_btn_deb.time_cnt[19]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
